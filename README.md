### More About Me

I've been enjoying web development for the first time ever since I built my first Spring Boot project. While I appreciate the diversity of technologies, my focus is on creating server-side solutions that are both reliable and efficient.

I'm currently on the look out for a role in backend web development, ideally writing Java, Kotlin, Python or Typescript. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
